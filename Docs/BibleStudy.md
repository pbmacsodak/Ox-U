# Bible Study

There are numerous reasons to incorporate Bible reading into our daily life flow. It keeps us connected with God through His Word. It reminds us of His character, His promises, and His great love for us. We need to know wwhat the Bible says so that we do not fall prey to those who want to twist the word to say things it is not meant to say. 

The following are all part of this requirement:
1. Students will be given a specific Bible reading plan to guide them in their daily Bible reading. 
1. Students will be required to memorize the books of the Bible, [Old Testament](../Files/OldTestamentBooks.md) and [New Testament](../Files/NewTestamentBooks.md) and be able recite them in the correct order. 
    
1.   Students will be required to learn the sections of the Bible, and what those sections represent.
       - There will be Bible studies going on constantly. **All** students, both ICA and OxU students, will

        all times.
1.    Bible verse memorization. There will be mandatory weekly Bible
        verse memorization for **ALL** students.
      - To start, student will memorize the verses used by the Navigator's in their [Topical Memory System](https://www.navigators.org/resource/topical-memory-system/).
