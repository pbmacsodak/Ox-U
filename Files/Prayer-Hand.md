Many believers find extended time in
prayer is a difficult spiritual discipline.
Here’s an easy way to remember five
essential aspects of prayer. Pray through
each of these five aspects, remembering
that prayer is really about aligning our
hearts with God’s, and as the fifth aspect
explains below, praises to God should
permeate every part.
```
| CONFESSION | Petition | INTERCESSION | THANKSGIVING | Praise |
| :---         |  :---       |  :---           |  :---           |  :---     |
|**I agree with God about my sin.** | **I ask God to provide for my needs.** | **I ask God to provide for the needs of others.**| **I thank God for what He has done in, through, and for me. I thank Him for His answers to prayers in the lives of those around me and for His ongoing work across the nation and the world.**| **I let my enjoyment and adoration of God overflow into words. As the thumb is able to touch all four other fingers, so praise should permeate every part of my prayer life. |
