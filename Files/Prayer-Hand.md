Many believers find extended time in
prayer is a difficult spiritual discipline.
Here’s an easy way to remember five
essential aspects of prayer. Pray through
each of these five aspects, remembering
that prayer is really about aligning our
hearts with God’s, and as the fifth aspect
explains below, praises to God should
permeate every part.
```
| <sup>1</sup> CONFESSION | <sup>2</sup> PETITION | <sup>3</sup> INTERCESSION | <sup>4</sup> THANKSGIVING | <sup>5</sup> PRAISE |
| :---         |  :---       |  :---           |  :---           |  :---     |
|**I agree with God about my sin.** “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.” **_1 John 1:9_** | **I ask God to provide for my needs.** “I prayed for this child, and the Lord has granted me what I asked of  him.” **_1 Samuel 1:27_** | **I ask God to provide for the needs of others.** “And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. Pray also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel...” **_Ephesians 6:18-19_** | **I thank God for what He has done in, through, and for me. I thank Him for His answers to prayers in the lives of those around me and for His ongoing work across the nation and the world.** “...always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” **_Ephesians 5:20_** | **I let my enjoyment and adoration of God overflow into words. As the thumb is able to touch all four other fingers, so praise should permeate every part of my prayer life.** “Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, my soul. I will praise the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.” **_Psalm 146:1-2_**|
